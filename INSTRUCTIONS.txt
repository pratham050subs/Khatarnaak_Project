# 🤖 Autonomous Testing Bot - Instructions

I have updated the website to look like a professional testing tool! Update your browser to see the changes.

## Features Added:
1.  **App Input**: She can type any app name (e.g. "YouTube", "WhatsApp").
2.  **Fake Logs**: It will scroll through "hacking" style text.
3.  **Manual Stabilization**: It will ask her to hold a button to "fix connection".
4.  **Crash & Reveal**: It fails dramatically and shows the love letter.

## How to Test:
1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  Enter an app name and click **INITIATE TEST RUN**.
3.  Wait for the logs.
4.  When it warns about "Connection Unstable", click and hold the orange button.

## Customization:
-   **Edit `script.js`**: Change names or add more specific log messages.
-   **Edit `index.html`**: Update the photo `src` to your own image!

Happy Valentine's Day! ❤️
